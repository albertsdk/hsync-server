## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- A resumable upload whose preflight offset no longer matches the server's
  `.part` (a duplicate writer appended bytes, or the partial was already
  renamed) answers `202` with the true offset and keeps the partial — the peer
  re-probes and resumes instead of failing permanently.
- Concurrent uploads to the same destination are serialized, so a duplicate
  trigger (watcher + full sync) can no longer corrupt the `.part` with two
  concurrent writers.
